<h1>How To Play ConnectN</h1>
<p>You select a column, and your piece, the X, falls to the bottom of the column.
    Then the computer plays an O, which does the same thing.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to place your pieces in a row, column, or diagonal of a certain length that depends on difficulty.</p>
<p>On the small board, you must get 3 in a row, 4 on a medium-sized board, and 5 on a large board.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
